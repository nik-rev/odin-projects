# Odin Projects

In January 2024 I started to learn programming. My first language was JavaScript. I learned HTML, CSS and JavaScript by following [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/), which is a curriculum for learning programming by reading documentation and building projects.

I completed the The Odin Project in about 2 months, and this repo contains these projects.
